# Project Structure

This section describes the organization of the Store Sales - Deep Learning Solution project. The structure follows best practices for reproducibility, modularity, and scalability, inspired by the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) template.
