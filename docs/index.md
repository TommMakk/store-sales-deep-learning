# Store Sales - Deep Learning Solution

Welcome to the documentation for the Store Sales - Deep Learning Solution project. This project provides a reproducible pipeline for forecasting store sales using deep learning, developed for the [Kaggle Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview) competition.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict daily sales for a large Ecuadorian grocery retailer using historical sales data, promotions, oil prices, holidays, and store information. The solution leverages modern data science best practices, modular code, and advanced deep learning techniques.

## Key Features

- Automated data processing and feature engineering pipelines
- Deep learning model built with Keras/TensorFlow
- Support for reproducible experiments and easy extensibility
- Modular project structure following [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) principles
