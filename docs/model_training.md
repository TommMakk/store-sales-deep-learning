# Model Training

This section describes the process of training the deep learning model for the Store Sales - Deep Learning Solution project.

## Overview

Model training involves fitting a neural network to the processed and feature-engineered sales data. The goal is to learn patterns and relationships that enable accurate sales forecasting.

## Steps for Model Training

1. **Prepare the Training and Validation Data**

   - Ensure that the processed datasets (including features and targets) are available in the `data/processed/` directory.
   - The data should be split into training and validation sets to monitor model performance and prevent overfitting.

2. **Run the Training Script**

   You can train the model using the provided script:

   python store-sales-DL/modeling/train.py

   or, using the Makefile:

   make train

3. **Training Details**

   - The script loads the processed data, builds the neural network, and trains it using the specified hyperparameters.
   - Early stopping is used to halt training when validation loss stops improving.
   - Model checkpoints and logs are saved for transparency and reproducibility.

4. **Output**

   - The best model is saved (e.g., as `models/best_model.keras`) for later inference.
   - Training and validation metrics are displayed and can be logged for further analysis.

## Notes

- You can adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) in the training script to experiment with different configurations.
- Ensure that the paths to data and model directories are correct in your environment.
- For best results, monitor validation metrics to avoid overfitting.
