# Deep Learning Approach

This section outlines the deep learning methodology used for the Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting project.

## Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**  
  Raw sales, oil, holiday, and store data are merged, missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Lag-based features, rolling statistics, and calendar-based features (such as day of week, holidays, and paydays) are generated to capture temporal patterns and external influences on sales.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Data distributions, trends, and correlations are visualized to inform feature selection and model design.

- **Model Development:**  
  The primary model is a feedforward neural network implemented in Keras/TensorFlow. The architecture consists of multiple dense layers with ReLU activations and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.

- **Training Strategy:**  
  The Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of 0.001. Early stopping is employed to halt training when validation loss stops improving, ensuring optimal generalization.

- **Evaluation:**  
  Model performance is monitored using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on a validation set. The final model is saved and used for inference on the test set.

## Model Architecture

- **Input Layer:** Accepts engineered features for each store-date-family combination.
- **Hidden Layers:** Two dense layers (96 and 64 units) with ReLU activation and dropout.
- **Output Layer:** Single neuron with linear activation for sales prediction.

## Training and Optimization

- **Optimizer:** Adam (learning rate = 0.001)
- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Batch Size:** 64
- **Epochs:** Up to 20, with early stopping (patience = 4)
- **Regularization:** Dropout (rate = 0.1) to reduce overfitting

## Reproducibility & Automation

- All steps, from data preparation to model training and inference, are automated via modular scripts.
- Model checkpoints and logs are saved for transparency and reproducibility.
